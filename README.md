A mod that adds Ruby items.

_The Fabric and Forge versions are currently broken: I only left them here so that people can try fixing it. If anybody can locate the issue, please create an issue on the GitHub repository with the fix. I also recommend commenting the fix in the issue reporting this in the Fabric 1.21.8 plugin for MCreator, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Goldorion/Fabric-Generator-MCreator/issues/571)._

This mod adds:
- Ruby
- Block of Ruby
- Ruby Ore
- Deepslate Ruby Ore
- Ruby Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots
- Ruby Sword, Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel, Hoe

Yep. That's all I have to say. I don't know what to add here.
